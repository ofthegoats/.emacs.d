* Move backups

By default, emacs will leave ~file~\~ all over the place - these files are
backups in the case of a crash or similar. Even if this is useful, it's
annoying. I would like to put them all in one place.

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups")))
#+end_src

* Load theme

#+begin_src elisp
  (load-theme 'tango-dark t)
#+end_src
